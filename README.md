# Web extensions

This is a collection of some browser extensions I've developed for fun. Each extension is organized in its own subfolder.

<!-- BEGIN INVENTORY -->

**[AtticGreek.org Additions](./atticgreek_additions)**: Some additions to the AtticGreek.org learning site.

**[Royal Flush](./royalflush)**: Automatically removes unimportant information concerning monarchies from most news agencies.

<!-- END INVENTORY -->

## Creating a new extension

Use the `scripts/new-extension.sh` script to create a new boilerplate extension, based on the current contents of the `template/` directory.
