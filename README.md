# Web extensions

This is a collection of some browser extensions I've developed for fun. Each extension is organized in its own subfolder.

[//]: # BEGIN INVENTORY
**[Beastify](././atticgreek_additions)**: Adds a browser action icon to the toolbar. Click the button to choose a beast. The active tab's body content is then replaced with a picture of the chosen beast. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Examples#beastify
**[Royal Flush](././royalflush)**: Automatically removes unimportant information concerning monarchies from most news agencies.

[//]: # END INVENTORY
